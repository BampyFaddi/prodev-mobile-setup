# 📱 Mobile Development Environment Setup — Task 0

## 🧩 Project Overview
This task sets up the mobile development environment using **Expo Framework**, **React Native**, and **TypeScript** for ALX Professional Development (ProDev).  
The goal is to ensure the environment runs smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices before app creation begins.

Both are verified and compatible with the Expo SDK requirements.

To continue progress, I used the **Expo Web Preview** option by running:

```bash
npx expo start
